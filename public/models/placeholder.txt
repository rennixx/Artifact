# Placeholder GLB Model
#
# This is a placeholder file. The actual .glb model should be placed here.
# For now, the LoadingPlaceholder component will be used instead.
#
# To add a real model:
# 1. Download a .glb file (e.g., from https://sketchfab.com)
# 2. Place it in public/models/placeholder.glb
# 3. The Model component will automatically load it
